# ALMS Application Workflow Documentation (Updated Flow)

## 1. Overview of Arms License Application Workflow
The Arms License Management System (ALMS) follows a structured workflow where applications are processed through various stages involving multiple roles. This document outlines the complete application lifecycle from submission to final disposal.

## 2. Application States
Applications in the ALMS system can exist in the following states:

| State       | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FRESH_FORM  | Initial state when the application is newly submitted                       |
| FORWARDED   | Application that has been forwarded to another authority                   |
| RETURNED    | Application that has been returned to the applicant for correction         |
| FLAGGED     | Application marked for special attention due to concerns                   |
| DISPOSED    | Application that has reached a final state (approved/rejected)             |
| APPROVED    | Application that has been approved for license issuance                    |
| REJECTED    | Application that has been rejected                                         |
| PENDING     | Application awaiting action                                                |

## 3. Detailed Application Workflow

### 3.1 New Application Submission Process
1. **Application Creation**  
   - Applicant logs into the system  
   - Fills out personal details, weapon details, reason for license  
   - Uploads required documents (ID proof, address proof, character certificate, etc.)  
   - Application saved with status **FRESH_FORM** and assigned a unique ID  

2. **Zonal Superintendent (ZS) Initial Review**  
   - ZS reviews **FRESH_FORM** applications  
   - Verifies documents, captures UIN/biometrics  
   - Possible actions by ZS:  
     - **Return** to applicant (→ RETURNED)  
     - **Flag** for concerns (→ FLAGGED)  
     - **Forward** to DCP for decision  

### 3.2 Officer Review & Enquiry Loop

1. **DCP Decision & Return**  
   - DCP reviews the package from ZS  
   - DCP may:  
     - **Return** to ZS for further action  
     - **Forward back** to ZS to request formal enquiry via ACP/SHO  
     - **Forward** to ZS to advance to ARMS Section  

2. **ZS-Orchestrated ACP → SHO Enquiry**  
   - ZS forwards to ACP to request SHO field enquiry  
   - ACP forwards to SHO  
   - SHO conducts enquiry, uploads report back to ACP  
   - ACP returns report to ZS  
   - ZS delivers the completed enquiry package back to DCP  

3. **Loop or Advance**  
   - After DCP reviews the SHO report, they may:  
     - **Loop back**: DCP → ZS (repeat enquiry sequence)  
     - **Advance**: DCP → ZS → ARMS Section  

### 3.3 Administrative Processing Chain

Once DCP → ZS forwards to **ARMS Section**:

1. **ARMS Section**  
   - Receives file from ZS  
   - Dispatches to one of the **ARMS Seats (A1–A4)**  

2. **ARMS Seats (A1–A4)**  
   - Perform seat-specific checks  
   - Return findings to **ARMS Section**  

3. **ARMS Section (Consolidation)**  
   - Collates seats’ findings  
   - Forwards consolidated file to **Administrative Officer (ADO)**  

4. **Administrative Officer (ADO)**  
   - Reviews documentation completeness  
   - Forwards to **Chief Administrative Officer (CADO)** or returns to ARMS Section for corrections  

5. **Chief Administrative Officer (CADO)**  
   - Conducts final administrative check  
   - Forwards to **Joint Commissioner of Police (JTCP)** or returns to ADO  

6. **Joint Commissioner of Police (JTCP)**  
   - Adds final recommendations  
   - Forwards to **Commissioner of Police (CP)** or returns to CADO  

7. **Commissioner of Police (CP) Final Decision**  
   - CP approves or rejects application  
   - On either outcome, initiates memo/letter generation (see § 3.4)  

### 3.4 Memo/Letter Generation & Proceedings

1. **Memo/Letter Chain**  
```

CP → JTCP → CADO → ADO → ARMS Section → ARMS Seat

```
- ARMS Seat produces and uploads the signed memo/letter.

2. **Proceedings Back-flow**  
```

ARMS Section → ZS → DCP

````
- ZS records proceedings, enters license number, completes the file.

### 3.5 License Issuance & Closure
- For approved applications: license PDF generated, applicant notified, details recorded.  
- All applications (approved or rejected) are archived and final status updated.  

> **Re-inquiry Note:**  
> At any “Return” step (applicant, ZS, ARMS Section, or ADO), the file loops back to the originating role for additional information before proceeding.
