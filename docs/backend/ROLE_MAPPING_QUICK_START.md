- Click category header checkbox to select all in that category
- Uncheck to deselect all
- Much faster than individual checkboxes

### 💡 Permission Count Summary
- See "X of Y" enabled for each category
- Helps understand role permissions at a glance
- Summary at bottom shows total permissions enabled

### 💡 Combine Filters
- Use search + status filter together
- Example: Search for "inspector" + filter by "active"

### 💡 Sort + Filter
- Sort while filtering

- Great for finding specific roles quickly
